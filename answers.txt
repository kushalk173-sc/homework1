A remote repository, in the context of software development and version control systems like Git, is a repository hosted on a remote server or platform that is used to store and manage the source code and related files of a project. Remote repositories are an essential part of distributed version control systems, enabling collaboration among multiple developers working on the same project, even if they are geographically dispersed.
